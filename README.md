I've been a software developer for a few years and love to explore multiple different subject areas. I'm a big believer that having a large breadth of experiences creates valuable perspectives and enables the cross-application of knowledge for novel solutions. I think a lot of fields are more closely related than people think! I hope to get my PhD studying the fusion of computing theory, electrical computer engineering, and cybersecurity to uncover how performance, security, and privacy can coexist in real-world systems. Although I consider security and computing theory my specialty, I'm also super interested in other areas like PL theory, systems engineering, robotics, computer vision, abstract mathematics, and really anything that has to offer great challenges.


Currently, I'm working in the intersection between academia and industry as a security researcher but I also have experience working on:
- Low-level Systems Development
- DevOps Engineering
- Cloud Computing Research
- Computer Vision
- Control Theory
- Software Reverse Engineering
- Zero-Knowlege and Elliptic Curve Cryptography
- Full Stack Application Development
- Distributed Computing
- Search Engines
- *Some* Market Making
